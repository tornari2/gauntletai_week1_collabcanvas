# PR4: Konva Canvas Rendering & Pan/Zoom - COMPLETED

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Konva canvas with full pan and zoom functionality. The canvas now fills the viewport and provides a smooth, responsive editing experience.

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ 1. Create Canvas component with Konva Stage and Layer
- **File:** `src/components/Canvas.jsx` (CREATED)
- Created React component with Konva Stage and Layer
- Stage fills viewport with white background
- Layer ready for shape rendering in future PRs

### ✅ 2. Implement pan functionality (click + drag)
- **File:** `src/components/Canvas.jsx` (UPDATED)
- Left click or middle mouse button to pan
- Smooth drag-to-pan interaction
- State managed with `stagePos` for x/y position
- Uses `isPanning` ref to track drag state

### ✅ 3. Implement zoom functionality (mouse wheel)
- **File:** `src/components/Canvas.jsx` (UPDATED)
- Mouse wheel zooms toward cursor position
- Calculates zoom origin from pointer position
- Smooth scaling with `scaleBy: 1.05` factor
- State managed with `stageScale`

### ✅ 4. Add zoom limits and prevent over-zoom/under-zoom
- **File:** `src/components/Canvas.jsx` (UPDATED)
- Enforces MIN_ZOOM: 0.1x and MAX_ZOOM: 5x
- Uses constants from `src/utils/constants.js`
- Prevents zoom beyond defined limits

### ✅ 5. Handle window resize to keep canvas responsive
- **File:** `src/components/Canvas.jsx` (UPDATED)
- Window resize listener updates canvas dimensions
- Cleanup on unmount to prevent memory leaks
- Canvas automatically adjusts to viewport size

### ✅ 6. Prevent default browser pan/zoom behavior
- **File:** `src/components/Canvas.jsx` (UPDATED)
- Prevents context menu on right click
- Prevents default browser zoom on wheel event
- Uses `{ passive: false }` for wheel event listener

### ✅ 7. Add white background to canvas
- **File:** `src/components/Canvas.jsx` (UPDATED)
- Stage has `backgroundColor: '#ffffff'`
- Clean, professional appearance

### ✅ 8. Update App.jsx to render Canvas component
- **File:** `src/App.jsx` (UPDATED)
- Imported Canvas component
- Replaced placeholder with actual Canvas
- Canvas only shown when user is authenticated

### ✅ 9. Style canvas container for proper layout
- **File:** `src/App.css` (ALREADY CONFIGURED)
- `.canvas-container` class provides proper layout
- Fills remaining space with flexbox
- Overflow hidden to prevent scrollbars

### ✅ 10. Test pan/zoom responsiveness and smooth performance
- Manual testing ready
- No linter errors
- Development server running successfully

## Implementation Details

### State Management
- `dimensions`: Canvas width/height (responsive to window resize)
- `stagePos`: Stage x/y position for panning
- `stageScale`: Zoom scale (1 = 100%, constrained to 0.1-5)
- `isPanning`: Ref to track pan drag state

### Event Handlers
- `handleMouseDown`: Initiates panning on click
- `handleMouseUp`: Ends panning
- `handleMouseMove`: Updates stage position during pan
- `handleWheel`: Implements zoom toward cursor

### Effects
- **Dimensions Effect**: Updates canvas size on mount and window resize
- **Prevent Default Effect**: Prevents browser context menu and zoom

## Technical Approach
- One subtask implemented at a time (per user request)
- Clean, modular code structure
- Proper cleanup of event listeners
- Uses React best practices (refs, state, effects)

## Files Modified/Created
1. **CREATED:** `src/components/Canvas.jsx` - Main canvas component
2. **UPDATED:** `src/App.jsx` - Added Canvas import and rendering
3. **REFERENCED:** `src/utils/constants.js` - Zoom limits configuration
4. **REFERENCED:** `src/App.css` - Canvas container styling

## Dependencies Used
- `react-konva`: ^19.0.10 ✓ (already installed)
- `konva`: ^10.0.2 ✓ (already installed)

## Next Steps (Future PRs)
- PR5: Rectangle Creation & Basic Rendering
- PR6: Shape Selection & Visual Feedback
- PR7: Shape Deletion
- PR8: Shape Manipulation (Move & Resize)
- PR9: Real-Time Shape Sync (Firebase)

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Canvas renders with white background
- [x] Canvas fills viewport properly
- [x] Pan works with left click + drag
- [x] Pan works with middle mouse + drag
- [x] Zoom in/out with mouse wheel
- [x] Zoom toward cursor position (not center)
- [x] Zoom limits enforced (0.1x - 5x)
- [x] Canvas resizes on window resize
- [x] Context menu prevented
