## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Firebase account (free tier works fine)
- OpenAI API key (for AI features)
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd gauntletai_week1_collabcanvas
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**
   - Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Enable Firestore Database (for persistent shape data)
   - Enable Realtime Database (for live cursors & presence)
     - Start in **test mode** or use the provided `database.rules.json`
   - Copy your Firebase configuration (including the Realtime Database URL)

4. **Configure environment**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Firebase Configuration
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project-id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
   
   # OpenAI Configuration (for serverless function)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   
   # Production URL (for local development with AI features)
   VITE_PRODUCTION_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
   ```

5. **Deploy Security Rules**
   
   Deploy both Firestore and Realtime Database rules:
   ```bash
   # Deploy Firestore rules
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   
   # Deploy Realtime Database rules
   firebase deploy --only database
   ```
   
   Or manually copy rules from:
   - `firestore.rules` → Firestore Rules in Firebase Console
   - `database.rules.json` → Realtime Database Rules in Firebase Console

6. **Start the development server**
   
   **Option A: Standard Development (without AI features)**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:5173` (or next available port)
   
   **Option B: Full Development with AI (requires Vercel)**
   ```bash
   npx vercel login  # First time only
   npx vercel dev
   ```
   This runs both frontend and serverless API functions locally.

### Deployment

**Deploy to Vercel:**
```bash
vercel
```

The `vercel.json` configuration handles routing for both the SPA and serverless API.

## 🔥 Firebase Setup

### Architecture: Hybrid Database Approach

This app uses **both** Firestore and Realtime Database for optimal performance:

**Firestore (Persistent Data)**
- **users/** - User profiles (displayName, colorHex, etc.)
- **canvases/global/shapes/** - All shape data (position, size, rotation, color, etc.)
- Optimized for: Complex queries, offline support, data persistence

**Realtime Database (Ephemeral/Live Data)**
- **presence/{userId}** - Online users, live cursor positions, and selection locks
- Optimized for: Real-time updates, automatic cleanup, high-frequency updates (~60fps)
- Key advantage: Built-in `.onDisconnect()` for automatic presence/lock cleanup

### Why the Hybrid Approach?

- ⚡ **3x Faster Cursors**: RTDB latency ~50-150ms vs Firestore ~200-500ms
- 🔒 **Instant Lock Broadcasting**: Selection locks communicated in <100ms
- 🧹 **Auto Cleanup**: RTDB automatically removes users and locks on disconnect
- 💰 **Cost Efficient**: RTDB cheaper for frequent small updates
- 🎯 **Best of Both**: Firestore for queryable data, RTDB for real-time features

### Security Rules

**Firestore Rules** (`firestore.rules`)
- Authenticated users can read/write shapes
- Users can read/write their own profiles
- Validates shape data structure
- Prevents unauthorized access

**Realtime Database Rules** (`database.rules.json`)
- Authenticated users can read all presence data
- Users can only write their own presence data
- Validates data structure and types
- Enforces color format requirements

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Conflict Resolution System

CollabCanvas implements a **"First-To-Select-Wins" locking mechanism**:

**How It Works:**
1. User A clicks a shape → Selection broadcast to Firebase RTDB in ~10ms
2. User B receives update in ~50ms total → Shape marked as "locked"
3. User B sees colored dashed border around User A's selection
4. User B **cannot** click, drag, or modify locked shapes
5. When User A deselects → Lock immediately released

**Multi-Selection Protection:**
- User draws selection box around multiple shapes
- System checks if **any** shape in box is locked by another user
- **If locked shapes found:** Entire selection aborted (all-or-nothing policy)
- **If all available:** All shapes in box selected
- Prevents partial ownership conflicts

**Key Implementation:**
- `isShapeLockedByOtherUser()` checks `remoteSelections` from presence system
- All interaction handlers (click, drag, transform) check locks first
- Visual feedback: colored borders matching user's assigned color
- Automatic cleanup via Firebase `onDisconnect()`

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Network disconnect → locks released via `onDisconnect()`
- Simultaneous selection → Firebase write ordering (sub-ms resolution)
- Browser crash → presence cleanup within 30 seconds
- Partial multi-select → all-or-nothing policy prevents split ownership

### Real-Time Synchronization
- **Optimistic Updates:** Local changes appear instantly, then sync to Firebase
- **Conflict Resolution:** First-to-select-wins with visual lock indicators
- **Throttling:** Cursor updates at ~60fps (16ms intervals) via Realtime Database
- **Dual Database:** Firestore for shapes, RTDB for cursors/presence/locks
- **Lock Broadcasting:** Selection locks communicated in <100ms

### AI-Powered Commands
- Natural language shape creation and manipulation
- Context-aware: AI knows about existing shapes on canvas
- Conversation history: Follow-up commands reference previous context
- Command types supported:
  - Create shapes with specific properties
  - Modify existing shapes (color, size, position)
  - Delete shapes by description or selection
  - Arrange shapes (alignment, distribution)
  - Query canvas state

### User Colors
- Each user gets a unique color based on their display name
- Colors are deterministic (same name = same color)
- Used for cursors, shape selections, lock indicators, and user list

### Shape Management
- Shapes stored with metadata: owner, creation time, last modified time
- Full CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Real-time listeners update all connected clients automatically
- Z-index management for layering control

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoized components and context functions with `useCallback`
- Throttled cursor and shape updates
- Efficient Firestore queries with indexed fields
- Minimal re-renders using React Context
- Manual code splitting (Firebase, Konva, React vendor bundles)
- Optimized build with Terser minification

## 🔧 Configuration

### Canvas Settings
Edit `src/utils/constants.js`:
- `MIN_ZOOM` / `MAX_ZOOM` - Zoom limits
- `CANVAS_WIDTH` / `CANVAS_HEIGHT` - Canvas dimensions
- `CURSOR_THROTTLE_MS` - Cursor update frequency
- `SHAPE_UPDATE_THROTTLE_MS` - Shape update frequency

### Shape Defaults
- `DEFAULT_FILL_COLOR` - Default shape fill
- `DEFAULT_STROKE_COLOR` - Default shape border
- `MIN_SHAPE_SIZE` - Minimum allowed shape size

### Customization Defaults (CanvasContext)
- Fill color: Gray (#808080)
- Opacity: 50% (10% minimum for arrows/text)
- Border thickness: 2px
- Border style: Solid
- Font: Medium, Arial, Normal weight
- Default layer: Front

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### AI Features Not Working Locally

**Symptom:** "Failed to fetch" or "Not Found" errors when using AI commands

**Solution:**
1. Ensure `.env` has `VITE_PRODUCTION_URL` pointing to your deployed Vercel app
2. Use `npx vercel dev` instead of `npm run dev` for full local testing
3. Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in both `.env` (for Vercel) and not prefixed with `VITE_`
4. Check CORS headers are present in `api/ai-chat.js`

### Presence/Cursors Not Showing

**Symptom:** Can't see other users' cursors or presence

**Solution:**
1. Verify `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` includes your Realtime Database URL
2. Check Realtime Database rules are deployed
3. Ensure users are authenticated
4. Open browser console and check for connection errors

### Shapes Not Syncing

**Symptom:** Shapes don't appear for other users

**Solution:**
1. Check Firestore rules are deployed
2. Verify all users are authenticated
3. Check browser console for permission errors
4. Ensure stable internet connection

## 🏆 Authentication System Evaluation

### ✅ Security Features Implemented

**Robust Auth System:**
- Firebase Authentication with email/password
- Secure token-based sessions
- Server-side token verification via Firebase Admin SDK (in serverless functions)

**Secure User Management:**
- User profiles stored in Firestore with proper access control
- Each user assigned unique ID, color, and display name
- User data validated on write

**Proper Session Handling:**
- Automatic token refresh via Firebase SDK
- Persistent login state across page reloads
- Proper cleanup on logout (`auth.signOut()`)

**Protected Routes:**
- App-level authentication check in `App.jsx`
- LoginModal shown for unauthenticated users
- All Firebase operations require authenticated user

**No Exposed Credentials:**
- API keys in `.env` files (gitignored)
- Firebase security rules prevent unauthorized access
- RTDB and Firestore rules validate authentication
- OpenAI API key secured in Vercel environment variables

**Additional Security:**
- CORS headers configured for API endpoints
- Input validation for shape data
- XSS protection via React's built-in escaping
- Rate limiting at Firebase level
