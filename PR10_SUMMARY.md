# PR10 Summary: Multiplayer Cursors

## Overview

Implemented real-time multiplayer cursor tracking that displays colored arrow cursors with username labels for all online users. Cursor positions sync every 50ms via Firebase Firestore for smooth, responsive collaboration.

---

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality

1. **Real-Time Cursor Sync**
   - Tracks local cursor position on canvas
   - Syncs position to Firestore every 50ms (throttled)
   - Receives remote cursor updates in real-time
   - Displays cursors for all online users

2. **Visual Design**
   - Colored SVG arrow icon matching user's color
   - Username label displayed next to cursor
   - Smooth transitions with 50ms CSS animation
   - Drop shadow for better visibility

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Throttled cursor updates (max 20 per second)
   - Prevents Firestore quota exhaustion
   - Efficient update scheduling with pending updates
   - Minimal performance impact on canvas rendering

4. **Smart Filtering**
   - Current user's cursor is excluded from rendering
   - Browser's native cursor is used for local user
   - Only remote users' cursors are displayed

## Files Created

### `src/components/Cursor.jsx`
**Purpose:** Renders individual remote user cursor with SVG arrow and label

**Key Features:**
- Absolutely positioned over canvas
- SVG arrow colored by user's colorHex
- Username label with colored background
- Pointer events disabled (doesn't interfere with canvas interactions)
- Smooth CSS transitions

**Component Structure:**
```jsx
<div className="remote-cursor" style={{ left, top }}>
  <svg className="cursor-arrow">
    <path fill={colorHex} stroke="white" />
  </svg>
  <div className="cursor-label" style={{ backgroundColor: colorHex }}>
    {displayName}
  </div>
</div>
```

### `src/styles/Cursor.css`
**Purpose:** Styles for remote cursor component

**Key Styles:**
- Absolute positioning with z-index 9999
- Smooth transitions (0.05s linear)
- Drop shadow on arrow for visibility
- Label positioned to the right of arrow
- Pointer-events: none to prevent interference

### `src/hooks/useCursorSync.js`
**Purpose:** Custom hook for throttled cursor position updates

**Key Features:**
- Throttles updates to 50ms intervals (20 per second)
- Immediate update if enough time has passed
- Schedules pending updates if throttled
- Clears pending updates when immediate update occurs
- Uses refs for performance (no re-renders)

**Throttling Logic:**
```javascript
// Update immediately if 50ms+ since last update
if (timeSinceLastUpdate >= 50ms) {
  updateCursorPosition(x, y)
} else {
  // Store pending update and schedule for later
  pendingUpdate.current = { x, y }
  setTimeout(() => updatePending(), delay)
}
```

## Files Modified

### `src/components/Canvas.jsx`
**Changes:**
1. **Imports:**
   - Added `usePresence` hook for cursor data
   - Added `useCursorSync` hook for syncing
   - Added `Cursor` component for rendering

2. **Cursor Tracking:**
   - Added `useEffect` for mousemove listener
   - Calculates cursor position relative to container
   - Syncs position via `syncCursorPosition(x, y)`
   - Only tracks when user is logged in

3. **Cursor Rendering:**
   - Maps through `cursors` object from PresenceContext
   - Filters out current user's cursor
   - Renders `Cursor` component for each remote user
   - Passes cursor position, display name, and color

**Code Added:**
```javascript
// Track cursor position
useEffect(() => {
  const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
    const rect = container.getBoundingClientRect()
    const x = e.clientX - rect.left
    const y = e.clientY - rect.top
    syncCursorPosition(x, y)
  }
  container.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove)
  return () => container.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove)
}, [currentUser, syncCursorPosition])

// Render remote cursors
{Object.entries(cursors).map(([userId, cursor]) => {
  if (userId === currentUser?.uid) return null
  return <Cursor key={userId} {...cursor} />
})}
```

### `src/hooks/usePresence.js`
**Existing Support:**
- Already listens to Firestore `presence` collection
- Already extracts cursor positions from presence data
- Already updates PresenceContext with `setAllCursors()`
- No changes needed - infrastructure was already in place!

### `src/context/PresenceContext.jsx`
**Existing Support:**
- Already has `cursors` state object
- Already has `setCursors()` function
- Already has `updateCursor()` helper
- No changes needed - infrastructure was already in place!

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User moves mouse
    ↓
Canvas.jsx: mousemove event
    ↓
useCursorSync: throttle to 50ms
    ↓
usePresence: updateCursorPosition()
    ↓
Firebase: presence/{userId} { cursorX, cursorY }
    ↓
Firestore: onSnapshot() listener
    ↓
usePresence: setAllCursors()
    ↓
PresenceContext: cursors state updated
    ↓
Canvas.jsx: re-renders with new cursors
    ↓
Cursor.jsx: displays remote cursors
```

### Firestore Structure

```javascript
presence/{userId} {
  userId: string,
  displayName: string,
  colorHex: string,
  cursorX: number,        // ← Added for PR10
  cursorY: number,        // ← Added for PR10
  lastActive: timestamp,
  onlineStatus: "online"
}
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Throttling Strategy:**
   - Updates limited to 50ms intervals (20 per second)
   - Pending updates stored and executed after delay
   - Prevents Firestore quota exhaustion
   - Balances responsiveness with efficiency

2. **Rendering Optimization:**
   - Cursors positioned via absolute positioning (no reflows)
   - CSS transitions handle smooth movement
   - Pointer-events: none prevents event handling overhead
   - Current user excluded from rendering (reduces one component)

3. **Memory Management:**
   - Uses refs for throttling state (no re-renders)
   - Cleanup functions remove event listeners
   - Cursor state cleanup on user logout

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Setup:**
   - Open two Chrome profiles (or Chrome + Firefox)
   - Navigate both to `http://localhost:5174`
   - Log in as different users (user1@test.com, user2@test.com)

2. **Test Cursor Visibility:**
   - Move mouse in Instance 1
   - Verify colored cursor appears in Instance 2
   - Verify cursor has correct username label
   - Verify cursor color matches user's color

3. **Test Cursor Movement:**
   - Move mouse smoothly in Instance 1
   - Verify cursor follows smoothly in Instance 2
   - Verify latency is <100ms
   - Verify no jittering or jumping

4. **Test Cursor Filtering:**
   - Move mouse in Instance 1
   - Verify no additional cursor appears in Instance 1
   - Only browser's native cursor should be visible locally

5. **Test Cursor Cleanup:**
   - Log out in Instance 1
   - Verify cursor disappears in Instance 2
   - Close browser in Instance 1
   - Verify cursor disappears in Instance 2

### Expected Behavior

✅ **Working Correctly:**
- Cursors appear for all remote users
- Cursors move smoothly with <100ms latency
- Cursor colors match user colors
- Username labels are visible and readable
- Current user's cursor is not duplicated
- Cursors disappear on logout/disconnect

❌ **Known Limitations:**
- Cursors use viewport coordinates (not canvas space)
- Cursors don't scale with zoom level
- No cursor trail or animation effects
- No cursor hiding on idle

## Firebase Integration

### Presence Document Structure

Each user's presence document now includes cursor position:

```javascript
{
  userId: "abc123",
  displayName: "Alice",
  colorHex: "#FF5733",
  cursorX: 250,          // Viewport X coordinate
  cursorY: 180,          // Viewport Y coordinate
  lastActive: Timestamp,
  onlineStatus: "online"
}
```

### Firestore Security Rules

Existing rules already support cursor updates:

```javascript
match /presence/{userId} {
  allow read: if isAuthenticated();
  allow write: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### Update Frequency

- **Throttle:** 50ms (20 updates per second)
- **Bandwidth:** ~40 bytes per update × 20/sec = ~800 bytes/sec per user
- **Firestore Reads:** ~20 per second per user (acceptable for free tier)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Canvas Space Coordinates:**
   - Convert to absolute canvas coordinates
   - Account for pan/zoom transformations
   - Display cursors in correct position regardless of viewport

2. **Cursor Animations:**
   - Add fade-in effect on user join
   - Add fade-out effect on user leave
   - Add pulsing animation on click

3. **Cursor States:**
   - Show different cursor for drawing mode
   - Show "grabbing" cursor when dragging shapes
   - Show crosshair cursor in rectangle mode

4. **Cursor Idle Detection:**
   - Hide cursor after 5 seconds of inactivity
   - Show "away" indicator for idle users
   - Stop syncing position when idle

5. **Advanced Features:**
   - Cursor trails (path history)
   - Cursor highlighting on click
   - Cursor name tooltips
   - Cursor clustering when users are close together
