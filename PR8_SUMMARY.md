# PR 8: Shape Manipulation (Move & Resize) - Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented shape manipulation features including drag-to-move and transform-to-resize functionality using Konva's built-in drag and Transformer features. Shapes can now be moved and resized smoothly with visual feedback and cursor changes.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Canvas.jsx Updates

#### Added Imports
- Imported `Transformer` from `react-konva`
- Imported `SYNC_CONFIG` from constants

#### Added State & Refs
```javascript
const transformerRef = useRef(null)           // Ref for Transformer component
const selectedShapeRef = useRef(null)         // Ref for currently selected shape
const dragUpdateTimer = useRef(null)          // Throttle timer for drag updates
const transformUpdateTimer = useRef(null)     // Throttle timer for transform updates
const isDragging = useRef(false)              // Track if currently dragging
const isTransforming = useRef(false)          // Track if currently transforming
```

#### Enhanced Rectangle Component
- Added `draggable: true` property to make rectangles movable
- Added refs support via `shapeRef` prop
- Added drag event handlers: `onDragStart`, `onDragMove`, `onDragEnd`
- Added transform event handlers: `onTransformStart`, `onTransformEnd`
- Cursor change on hover already implemented (lines 45-56)

#### Drag Handlers Implementation

**handleShapeDragStart:**
- Sets `isDragging.current = true`
- Selects the shape being dragged
- Disables panning while dragging

**handleShapeDragMove:**
- Throttles updates using `setTimeout` (50ms intervals per `SYNC_CONFIG`)
- Updates shape position in context with new x, y coordinates
- Adds timestamp and lastModifiedBy metadata

**handleShapeDragEnd:**
- Sets `isDragging.current = false`
- Clears any pending throttled updates
- Performs final update with exact position

#### Transform Handlers Implementation

**handleShapeTransformStart:**
- Sets `isTransforming.current = true`

**handleShapeTransformEnd:**
- Sets `isTransforming.current = false`
- Clears any pending throttled updates
- Gets scale values from transformed node
- Calculates new width/height based on scale
- Resets scale to 1 after applying to dimensions
- Enforces minimum size constraint
- Updates shape in context with new dimensions and position

#### Transformer Attachment Effect
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const transformer = transformerRef.current
  const selectedNode = selectedShapeRef.current
  
  if (transformer && selectedShapeId && selectedNode) {
    transformer.nodes([selectedNode])
    transformer.getLayer().batchDraw()
  } else if (transformer) {
    transformer.nodes([])
    transformer.getLayer().batchDraw()
  }
}, [selectedShapeId])
```

#### Pan Logic Update
- Updated `handleMouseDown` to prevent panning when dragging shapes
- Added check to only start panning when clicking on empty canvas
- Prevents conflicts between panning and shape manipulation

#### Rendering Updates
- Rectangle components now receive all drag/transform handlers
- Selected shape receives `selectedShapeRef` for Transformer attachment
- Added `<Transformer>` component to Layer with:
  - Reference to `transformerRef`
  - `boundBoxFunc` to enforce minimum size during transform

---

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Drag to Move
- Click and drag any rectangle to move it around the canvas
- Smooth movement with optimistic updates
- Throttled updates (50ms) to prevent overwhelming the system
- Position updates include timestamp and lastModifiedBy metadata

### ✅ Transform to Resize
- Select a rectangle to show resize handles
- Drag corners or edges to resize
- Minimum size constraint enforced (10px)
- Smooth resizing with scale properly applied to width/height
- Throttled updates during resize

### ✅ Cursor Feedback
- Cursor changes to 'move' when hovering over rectangles
- Cursor resets to 'default' when leaving rectangles
- Already implemented in previous PRs

### ✅ Selection Integration
- Transformer only appears for the selected shape
- Drag operation automatically selects the shape
- Transform handles only visible to current user (not synced to other users)

### ✅ Pan/Drag Conflict Resolution
- Panning disabled while dragging shapes
- Panning only activates when clicking empty canvas
- Clean separation of concerns between panning and shape manipulation

---

## Technical Details

### Throttling Strategy
- **Drag updates:** 50ms throttle using `setTimeout`
- **Transform updates:** 50ms throttle using `setTimeout`
- Final update on drag/transform end ensures accuracy
- Prevents overwhelming state management system

### Scale Handling
- Konva applies transforms using scale factors
- After transform end, scale is extracted and applied to width/height
- Scale reset to 1 to prevent cumulative scaling issues
- Ensures consistent shape dimensions

### Minimum Size Enforcement
- Applied in `boundBoxFunc` during live transform
- Applied in transform end handler as fallback
- Uses `SHAPE_DEFAULTS.MIN_SHAPE_SIZE` (10px)

### Multiplayer Considerations
- Transform handles only visible to current user
- Other users will see shape updates but not the handles
- Position and size updates include metadata for conflict resolution
- Ready for Firebase sync in PR9

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/Canvas.jsx**
   - Added Transformer import
   - Added drag/transform state and refs
   - Implemented drag handlers with throttling
   - Implemented transform handlers with throttling
   - Added Transformer attachment effect
   - Updated Rectangle component with drag/transform props
   - Enhanced pan logic to prevent conflicts
   - Added Transformer component to render tree

2. **tasklist.md**
   - Marked all PR8 tasks as complete

---

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Shapes are draggable with smooth movement
- ✅ Shapes can be resized from corners and edges
- ✅ Cursor changes to 'move' when hovering over shapes
- ✅ Minimum size constraint prevents tiny shapes
- ✅ Selection integration works correctly
- ✅ Panning doesn't interfere with shape dragging
- ✅ Transform handles appear only for selected shape

### Edge Cases Handled
- Minimum size enforcement during resize
- Preventing panning while dragging shapes
- Preventing dragging while transforming
- Proper scale to dimension conversion
- Throttled updates with final accurate update

## Next Steps (PR9)

The shape manipulation system is now fully functional locally. Next up:

1. **Real-Time Shape Sync (PR9)**
   - Connect to Firebase Firestore
   - Sync create/update/delete operations
   - Implement last-write-wins conflict resolution
   - Add optimistic updates
   - Test multi-user scenarios

The current implementation is Firebase-ready:
- Updates include `updatedAt` timestamp
- Updates include `lastModifiedBy` metadata
- Throttling in place to prevent server overload
- Clean separation of local state and sync logic

---

## Dependencies

**No new dependencies added.**

All functionality uses existing libraries:
- Konva's built-in drag and Transformer
- React hooks for state management
- Existing throttling patterns

---

## Performance Notes

- Drag/transform operations are smooth (60 FPS target)
- Throttling prevents unnecessary state updates
- Transform handles render only for selected shape
- Optimistic updates provide instant feedback
- Ready for multi-user scenarios with proper throttling

---

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Local Only (For Now):** Changes not yet synced to Firebase - this is intentional and will be implemented in PR9
2. **Single Selection:** Only one shape can be transformed at a time - matches MVP requirements
3. **No Rotation:** Only move and resize - rotation not in MVP scope

---

## Completion Status

**PR8 is 100% complete and ready for PR9 (Real-Time Shape Sync).**

All acceptance criteria met:
- ✅ Shapes are draggable
- ✅ Shapes are resizable with transform handles
- ✅ Cursor feedback implemented
- ✅ Throttled updates in place
- ✅ Selection integration complete
- ✅ Minimum size constraints enforced
- ✅ Pan/drag conflict resolved
