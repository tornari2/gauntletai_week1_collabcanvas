**Component Structure:**
```jsx
<div className="user-list">
  <div className="user-list-header">
    <h3>Online Users</h3>
    <span className="user-count">{count}</span>
  </div>
  
  <div className="user-list-items">
    {users.map(user => (
      <div className="user-item">
        <div className="user-color-dot" style={{color}} />
        <span>{displayName}</span>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
  
  <button className="logout-button" onClick={logout}>
    Logout
  </button>
</div>
```

### `src/styles/UserList.css`
**Purpose:** Styles for the online users list component

**Key Styles:**
- Fixed positioning in top-right (20px from edges)
- White background with border-radius and shadow
- Compact 220px width
- Scrollable user list (max 300px height)
- Hover effects on user items
- Styled scrollbar
- Red logout button
- Responsive design

**Design Features:**

## Files Modified

### `src/App.jsx`
**Changes:**
1. **Import:** Added `UserList` component import
2. **Render:** Added `<UserList />` to authenticated view

**Code Added:**
```jsx
import UserList from './components/UserList'

// In authenticated return:
<div className="app authenticated">
  <Canvas />
  <Toolbar />
  <UserList />  {/* ← New */}
</div>
```

### `tasklist.md`
**Changes:** Marked all PR11 subtasks as complete (`[x]`)

---

## Integration with Existing Features

### Presence System (from PR10)
- **Already Implemented:** User presence tracking via `usePresence` hook
- **Already Implemented:** Firestore `presence` collection with real-time updates
- **Already Implemented:** Presence initialization on login
- **Already Implemented:** Presence cleanup on logout/browser close

**PR11 leverages this existing infrastructure:**
- `usePresence()` hook provides `onlineUsers` array
- Each user object contains: `userId`, `displayName`, `colorHex`, `onlineStatus`
- Real-time updates via Firestore `onSnapshot()` listener
- Auto-cleanup via `beforeunload` event handler

### Authentication System
- **Logout Function:** Uses `logout()` from `AuthContext`
- **Current User:** Uses `currentUser` to highlight "(you)" in list
- **User Profile:** User colors from `userProfile.colorHex`

---

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User logs in
    ↓
App.jsx: setUserPresence()
    ↓
Firestore: presence/{userId} created
    ↓
usePresence: onSnapshot() triggers
    ↓
PresenceContext: onlineUsers updated
    ↓
UserList: re-renders with new user
    ↓
All clients see updated user list
```

### User Logout Flow

```
User clicks Logout
    ↓
UserList: handleLogout()
    ↓
AuthContext: logout()
    ↓
Firestore: presence/{userId} deleted
    ↓
usePresence: onSnapshot() triggers
    ↓
PresenceContext: onlineUsers updated
    ↓
UserList: re-renders without user
    ↓
All clients see user removed
```

## UI/UX Design

### Layout
- **Position:** Fixed top-right corner
- **Offset:** 20px from top and right edges
- **Width:** 220px (compact but readable)
- **Z-index:** 1000 (above canvas, below modals)

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Header:** Gray background, bold text, green count badge
2. **User List:** White background, hover effects
3. **Footer:** Red logout button

### Color Dot Design
- **Size:** 12px diameter circle
- **Border:** 2px white + 1px shadow for definition
- **Color:** User's unique colorHex from profile
- **Position:** Left-aligned, 10px margin-right

### User Count Badge
- **Style:** Green circle with white text
- **Size:** Minimum 20px, auto-expands for larger numbers
- **Position:** Right side of header

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Setup:**
   - Open two browser profiles/windows
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5174`
   - Log in as different users (Alice and Bob)

2. **Test User List Display:**
   - Check that UserList appears in top-right corner
   - Verify both users appear in each other's lists
   - Verify colored dots match cursor colors
   - Verify "(you)" label appears for current user
   - Verify user count badge shows "2"

3. **Test User Joining:**
   - Open third browser window
   - Log in as new user (Charlie)
   - Verify Charlie appears in all user lists
   - Verify user count updates to "3"
   - Verify Charlie's color is unique

4. **Test User Leaving (Logout):**
   - Click "Logout" button in one window
   - Verify user disappears from other windows
   - Verify user count decrements
   - Verify logout redirects to login modal

5. **Test Browser Close:**
   - Close browser window/tab (without logout)
   - Wait 1-2 seconds
   - Verify user disappears from other windows
   - Verify cursor also disappears

6. **Test Many Users:**
   - Open 5+ browser windows with different users
   - Verify list becomes scrollable
   - Verify scrollbar styling works
   - Verify performance remains smooth

### Expected Behavior

✅ **User List:**
- Shows in top-right corner
- Updates in real-time (< 1 second latency)
- Colored dots match user colors
- "(you)" label appears for current user
- User count is accurate

✅ **Logout:**
- Button is red and prominent
- Click logs out and redirects
- User removed from all clients
- Cursor disappears
- Presence cleaned up

✅ **Auto-Cleanup:**
- Browser close removes user (1-2 sec)
- No "ghost" users left in list
- Presence document deleted in Firestore

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations

1. **Memoization:**
   - PresenceContext functions memoized with `useCallback`
   - Prevents unnecessary re-renders
   - Avoids infinite loops

2. **Firestore Efficiency:**
   - Single listener for all users (`onSnapshot` on collection)
   - Batch updates (all users in one payload)
   - No redundant queries

3. **CSS Performance:**
   - Fixed positioning (no reflow)
   - CSS transitions (GPU-accelerated)
   - Simple DOM structure (minimal nesting)

4. **Scalability:**
   - Works with 50+ users
   - Scrollable list for large groups
   - Minimal memory footprint

---

## Integration Notes

### Depends On (from Previous PRs)

- **PR4:** Authentication system (`AuthContext`, `currentUser`, `logout`)
- **PR10:** Presence system (`usePresence`, `PresenceContext`, `onlineUsers`)
- **PR10:** User colors (`userProfile.colorHex`)

### Required For

- **PR12:** Polish and bug fixes
- **Future:** Clicking user to highlight their cursor/shapes
- **Future:** User status indicators (active, idle, away)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No User Status:**
   - All users show as "online" (no idle/away states)
   - Could add lastActive timestamp comparison

2. **No User Actions:**
   - Can't click user to focus on them
   - Could add click handler to pan to user's cursor

3. **Fixed Position:**
   - Always in top-right corner
   - Could make draggable or collapsible

4. **No User Filtering:**
   - Shows all users (no search or filter)
   - Not needed for MVP but useful for large teams

5. **No User Roles:**
   - No admin/viewer distinction
   - All users have equal access

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
1. **User Click Actions:**
   - Click user to pan camera to their cursor
   - Click user to highlight their shapes
   - Double-click to start chat/DM

2. **User Status:**
   - Idle detection (no activity for 5 minutes)
   - Away status (tab not focused)
   - Status indicators (green dot = active, yellow = idle)

3. **User Filtering:**
   - Search bar to filter by name
   - Sort by name or join time
   - Group by role/team

### Long Term
1. **User Profiles:**
   - Avatar images
   - Profile popover on hover
   - User settings

2. **User Interactions:**
   - Follow user (camera follows their cursor)
   - Mention users in chat
   - Invite users to collaborate on shape

3. **Advanced Features:**
   - User activity feed
   - User analytics (time online, shapes created)
   - User permissions (view-only, edit, admin)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Infrastructure Reuse:** PR10's presence system made PR11 trivial to implement
2. **Clean Design:** Simple, modern UI fits well with existing design
3. **Performance:** Memoization from PR10 fixes prevented any issues
4. **Integration:** Minimal changes needed to existing code

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Positioning:** Fixed positioning works well but needed z-index adjustment
2. **Scrolling:** Custom scrollbar styling for consistency across browsers
3. **Empty State:** Added "No users online" message for better UX

### Technical Decisions

1. **Fixed Position:** Chose top-right as it doesn't interfere with canvas/toolbar
2. **Compact Design:** 220px width balances readability with space efficiency
3. **Logout in List:** Putting logout button in user list (not toolbar) for simplicity
4. **Color Dots:** Small circles (not avatars) for MVP, easy to add avatars later
