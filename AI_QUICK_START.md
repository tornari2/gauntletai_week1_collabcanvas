# AI Canvas Agent - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Add Your OpenAI API Key

1. Open the `.env.local` file in the project root
2. Replace `your-openai-api-key-here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
3. Save the file

**Don't have an API key?** Get one at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

If the server is already running, restart it to load the new environment variable.

### Step 3: Open the AI Assistant

1. Log in to your canvas
2. Look for the **🤖 AI Assistant** button on the right side
3. Click it to open the chat panel
4. Try one of these commands:

```
Create a red circle at the center
Make a 3x3 grid of blue squares
Create a login form
Build a navigation bar with 4 menu items
```
